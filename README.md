# Computer-Graphics
## Academic Context:
* Project for the subject Computer Graphics made in C++ and OpenGL
* Faculty of Technical Sciences
* Computer Science and Automation
* Applied Computer Science and Informatics

## Projects Description:
* 2D: The scene shows a seascape with several islands, sharks, palm tree, fire, clouds, sun and moon. Acceleration and deceleration of time (movement in the scene) are enabled.

* 3D:Initially, an isometric camera is active, so that the whole scene is visible. User input allows: perspective changes, movement in all directions, and rotation of the view. The 2D project scene is expanded by adding models (sharks), four light sources (sun, moon, fire, spotlight). Three types of lighting are implemented (directional, point, spotlight). All the functionalities from the 2D project are translated into the 3D project.
##
## Key bindings in 2D:
* Toggle time: +(acceleration), -(deceleration), R(start)
* Toggle scene-preview: 1(points), 2(lines), 3(full scene)
* Toggle palm: P(palm tree), D(politician) 
* Exit: ESC
## Key bindings in 3D(also everything from 2D project):
* Move: WASD
* Look: Arrow keys
* Toggle lighthouse and clouds: P and O
* Toggle projection: O(orthogonal), P(perspective)
